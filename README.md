Parallel-3-bit-Multiplier with 1-bit-adders

Place the files in the designs folder given in the OpenLane Top-level folder

Or place them in any folder but do not forget to mention the path in the configuration tcl file and in constraints file

This design is only for learning and experimentation

change the constraints and configuration file declarations for pdn etc.., according to the learners wishes 

to see the changes occuring in layouts and to see if the design is complying with the LVS, DRC, PEX

If you have custom constraints for pnr and signoff place them in respective pnr sdc file and signoff sdc files

When using any other technology nodes such as NCSU's FreePDK 45 or any other be sure to mention the file path wherever required.

We can notice changes due to scaling when using different PDK's

If facing any trouble regarding the syntaxes to run the design refer to OpenLane Documentation center "https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/configuration.html"

Hope this project helps even if it's little.
